#### Where?

Today's offering comes courtesy of The George IV in Baldock, Hertfordshire. Situated on the outskirts of this historic market town the pub nestles in the foot of the Chiltern ridge. 

This is a large Greene King managed house under their Old English Inns brand. It has a large open plan bar area with mixed seating and an open fire, alongside a designated dining area where reservations are accepted. Outside are extensive gardens with play areas for the kids.

#### Why?

Arriving on a Monday lunchtime in January we expected to find the place empty, but were amazed to find almost every table taken instead. This did not detract from the quality of our experience as we were quickly pointed to an empty table by the friendly lady at the bar, and drinks were dispensed post haste. 

#### What?

The food offering is wide & varied, a bargain 'from £4.99 menu' operates along side a full main menu, special list, over 55's menu and offerings for speciality evenings such as ' curry night' & 'steak night'. Spoilt for choice I plumped for a turkey & ham pie from the daily specials and my partner went for the Chicken,leek & white wine pot pie from the main menu.

The food arrived without delay and was presented pleasantly enough. My pie was generous and full of meat under a flaky puff pastry top. Lots of flavour and given the size of the pie, not too many chips or vegetables. The pot pie came freestanding ( no dish) and had a well cooked crust without the dreaded soggy bottom. Plenty of filling, and fresh vegetables with only the slightly dry mash being a disappointment. It had probably sat under a heat lamp for too long. Although described as with 'champ' mash, it was in fact plain. So not quite as expected.

#### Well

Overall not a bad experience, hot, home cooked food, served promptly and pleasantly in welcoming surroundings is not a disappointment on a wet Monday in January. Total cost inc 2 drinks just under £20, can't argue with that. **4 out of 5**.
