#### Where?

The [Bison Grill Bistro], snugly set inside an impresive timber framed Rhug Estate Farm Shop, on the way to Snowdonia.

#### Why?

On our way to Snowdonia today for a couple of nights rest after the mania of Christmas. Thought we'd stop at Rhug Estate's Bison Grill for a snack lunch. Been here a couple of times before, the foods always good and the team are always welcoming and attentive.

Today was no exception, arriving at about 12.30 they were already busy inside and there was a queue outside for the takeaway/outdoor eaters (still snow lying and 3c!)

#### What?

![Crunchy pork crackling with apple sauce.][crackling]

Thought we'd treat ourselves to the Crackling & Apple Sauce as a nibbler before our sandwiches. Delicious crispy crackling, well seasoned with cracked black pepper and served with a delicious homemade apple sauce, yum!

![Chicken and bacon rolls.][rolls]

The sandwiches, Chicken & Bacon with Egg Mayonnaise, Rocket & a sun-dried Tomato chutney were lovely, perhaps a bit too much bread, but the rocket lightened this up.

#### Well?

Service was prompt, but not rushed, and all around us tables were coming & going with a mixture of families, well to do local couples & groups of friends, keeping the team busy. Despite being busy, nothing was forgotten, offers of sauces for the shoestring fries, dessert menus etc, all delivered with smiles and thank you's.

this is a gem and one we'll be back at before too long. **4/5**
