#### Where?

Today's offering comes courtesy of the White Waters Hotel in Llangollen - North Wales.  Having had a lovely, if decidedly damp, walk around nearby Bala we chose to try this eatery due to its location. Situated on the A5, the hotel nestles into the bank of the River Dee at a point which allows those so inclined to try white water canoeing.

#### Why?

Arriving well after the traditional lunch hour, there were a half dozen or so tables occupied around the open planned bar/lounge/restaurant area. The decor is decidedly 80's/90's but there was a pleasant log burner and the atmosphere was friendly. 

As we knew we're having our main meal this evening we thought a couple of sandwiches would do. The food offered comes in 3 ways, a Carvery, an a'la carte menu full of pub grub staples and a bar menu with jacket potatoes, filled ciabatta, sandwiches & omelettes on. 

#### What?

![The cheese is strong with this one][cheese]

The Mighty Mouse went for a 'Strong Welsh Cheddar & pickle' & I opted for 'Coronation Chicken'. Both were ordered on brown bread, and we added some chips to share.

The sandwiches came with a dressed salad garnish, coleslaw and some crisps. My sandwich could have done with a bit more sauce & slightly less chicken. Not sure the filling was homemade, the bread was undoubtably fresh, but not homemade. The issue really came with the chips

![They dont taste how they look..][chips]

......overlooked, soggy, greasy....I won't go on! Add that plus the coleslaw was warm, probably been sat out on the plate for an hour or 2.

#### Well?

Overall not great, but not overpriced either at just under Â£18 inc drinks. **2/5**
